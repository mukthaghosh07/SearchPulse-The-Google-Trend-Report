Step 1: Access SerpAPI
Go to SerpAPI and log in to your account.
Step 2: Get Your API Key & sign in or login in SerpAPI account 
Navigate to the Account section to find your API key.
Step 3: Define API Parameters 
In Power BI, set up the API parameters. Use the following structure to define your query:
plaintext
Copy this code:
apiUrl = "https://serpapi.com/search.json"
queryParams = [
    engine = "google_trends",
    q = "Data Analyst,The Developer,Jobs,India,Power BI",
    data_type = "GEO_MAP",
    date = "today 5-y",
    tz = "-330",
    api_key = "Your API Key Here"
]
Step 4: Make the API Request
Combine the API endpoint and parameters to form the complete URL:
plaintext
Copy code
fullUrl = apiUrl & "?" & Uri.BuildQueryString(queryParams)
response = Web.Contents(fullUrl)
Step 5: Parse the JSON Response
Parse the JSON response to convert it into a usable table format:
plaintext
Copy code
jsonResponse = Json.Document(response)
dataTable = Table.FromRecords({jsonResponse})
comparedBreakdownByRegion = dataTable{0}[compared_breakdown_by_region]
Step 6: Repeat for Additional Data
Repeat the process for other data types, such as interest over time and related keywords, adjusting the queryParams as necessary for each request.
